## //TODO: Meet You.
A dating site catered towards singles in the tech industry. Users can browse profiles, like and unlike users and message potential matches.

## How to use
* Sign up by passing a simple code test
* Log in via the homepage if you have an account
* Create your dating profile
* Find matches by liking or unliking profiles in our user list
* View your matches in the 'My matches' tab to see who has liked you back

## Objectives

* Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
